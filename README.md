# Resumate

## Introduction
Resumate is a web tool that helps people create resumes easily. The user fills in simple text boxes with their personal information, work experience, and skills. After that, the website creates a ready-to-use resume based on the given information.

The site offers many different resume styles, so users can choose the one they like most or the one that fits the job they are applying for. Resumate makes resume creation faster and easier, especially for people who do not have much experience with design or formatting.

### Main features

## Start of the project
This project shows my learning process and development during the cloud computing course. At the beginning of the course, I was able to build cloud architectures with guidance, and I had a basic understanding of backend programming. After completing the project, my cloud skills, especially with AWS, improved significantly, and I became more confident working with cloud-based systems.

The main part of the project is presented through a cloud architecture diagram with clear explanations of the technology choices. This helps show how the application is built and why certain cloud services were selected. The side work of the project is shown through backend code snippets that I had to learn and write so that the application works correctly in the cloud environment.

## During the project
During the project, I realized that traditional programming is not the area I enjoy the most. I prefer working with cloud services, infrastructure, and architecture design. This project helped me confirm that cloud technologies are the area where I want to focus in my future career.

One of my main goals was to build a working cloud architecture for the application, and this goal was achieved. I also learned new backend programming skills while working on the project. In addition to technical skills, I improved my teamwork skills by working together with others and solving problems as a team.

## Future
In the future, I see myself working on different projects, but I hope to focus mainly on cloud services rather than traditional programming tasks. My career goal is to work in a role where I can design cloud architectures or work as a cloud consultant.

The course supported these goals well by teaching how to move from an idea to architecture design and implementation. It also helped me understand how to choose the right technologies based on the project needs.

## After school
To reach my goals, I still need to deepen my technical skills, gain more work experience, and complete AWS certifications. My strengths include problem-solving skills, patience, and strong interest in cloud services, especially AWS. These strengths became clearer during the project, as I faced new challenges and enjoyed solving them.

I chose this project and its documents for my portfolio because they best show my work, my learning process, and the challenges I faced while building a cloud-based application.
